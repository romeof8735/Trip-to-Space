### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to use our skills of Git and Github to create our own adventure. We were taught how to create files in our IDE so we created files that tells a story and each file leads to different outcomes. In this project the story is that you start on a NASA space ship and you are sent up into orbit to either head to Mars or Jupiter where your story will begin.
